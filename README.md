Python Implementation of Revealed Preference Tests
*Requires NumPy (https://numpy.org) and NetworkX (https://networkx.org) packages.

- garp_sarp.py implements tests for:
    - Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences GARP
    - Strong Axiom of Revealed Preferences SARP

- differentiable.py implements tests for:
   - smooth_GARP: rationalization by differentiable utility
   - smooth_SARP: rationalization by a differentiable and strictly concave utility
   - SSARP: Strong SARP proposed by Chiappori and Rochet (1987)

- harp_cm.py implements tests for:
   - Homothetic Axiom of Revealed Preferences HARP and
   - Cyclical Monotonicity, which is the test for rationalization by a quasilinear utility
